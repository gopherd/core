// Package container provides a collection of Go data structures and algorithms
// for managing and manipulating various types of containers.
//
// This package includes several sub-packages, each focusing on a specific
// data structure or container type:
//
//   - heap: Implements a heap data structure.
//   - history: Provides data structures with undo functionality.
//   - maps: Contains implementations and utilities for map-like structures.
//   - pair: Implements a pair data structure for storing two related values.
//   - slices: Offers utilities and algorithms for working with slices.
//   - tree: Provides functionality for working with tree-like data structures.
//   - trie: Provides an implementation of the trie data structure.
//   - tuple: Implements tuple-like structures for Go.
//
// Each sub-package is designed to be efficient and easy to use, following
// Go's idiomatic practices. Users can import and use these sub-packages
// independently based on their specific needs.
//
// For detailed information on each sub-package, refer to their respective
